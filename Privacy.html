<br>4.	We take extra precautions for our younger learners under the age of 13, including restricting child accounts to automatically block features that would allow a child to post or disclose personal information.
<br>5.	We do not display advertising on Khan Academy. Our mission is to provide you with a better learning experience, not to sell you products.
