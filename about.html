          <h5>Group Phoenix is basically operated and maintained by five of its group members. All of them are Intending to start online graphics learning academy for free which can help a bunch of people who is willing to build up their career on graphic design. I’m always interested about graphic design and wanted to have a platform for those students who is not capable of paying but egger to learn graphic design and build up his career on this.
All of we are student of university, facing some problem while try to learn it from online. There are many learning websites but most of them are paid website that’s why we couldn’t find the best materials to learn it. From then, we were committed to open an online learning platform for the students who is not capable of pay but they must have the access of the most effective and sophisticated materials.</h5>
